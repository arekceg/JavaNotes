# Course Update Guide

This course received a major update on **October 23rd 2023**.

Here's a quick summary of the update and what it means for you:
- If you're already enrolled into the existing React course, you're getting this **update for free!** → You were automatically enrolled into the updated course
- The update provides new content for roughly the **first half of the course** (~24h of old content is replaced) - the rest of the course was already updated earlier in 2023 or didn't need any update
- Therefore, the new course is essentially the old course, with the first half (the sections between "Getting Started" and "Diving into Redux" (excluded)) being replaced with new sections
- **React itself did not change** - the course was updated to pick up student feedback, improve it, provide better & more demo projects, cover more patterns & best practices etc.
- You therefore **don't have to restart the course** - you can ignore the new, updated content if you're currently taking the course
- You can, of course, switch to the new course if you want to → The structure is pretty much the same, so you can switch at (almost) any point
- The first couple of sections that cover base React concepts were replaced by new "React Essentials" sections → If you're currently in those first few base sections, you can only switch by restarting at the beginning of the new "React Essentials" sections
- The "old course" will **not** be removed
