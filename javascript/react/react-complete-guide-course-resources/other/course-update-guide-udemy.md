# Course Update Guide

This course received a major update on **October 23rd 2023**.

Here's a quick summary of the update and what it means for you. Definitely also explore the rest of this document to learn more about the details of this update, how you should proceed based on your current course progress etc.

- Existing students get the **update for free** - the new content was inserted into the existing course
- The update provides new content for roughly the **first half of the course** (~24h of old content is replaced) - the rest of the course was already updated earlier in 2023 or didn't need any update
- **React itself did not change** - the course was updated to pick up student feedback, improve it, provide better & more demo projects, cover more patterns & best practices etc.
- You therefore **don't have to restart the course**, your current learning journey will not be interrupted
- If you're **currently taking the course** you can simply continue with the lecture you're currently viewing - the new content was inserted such that you'll automatically get switched to the new content at some point (by simply progressing with the course, [learn more below](#youre-currently-taking-the-course))
- If you already **finished the course**, you can ignore the update - though you're of course invited to explore the new content & demo projects
- If you **haven't started the course yet**, you should simply start at lecture 1 in section 1 and go through the course lecture-by-lecture, section-by-section → you'll automatically use the updated content
- The **old course content is still there**, it will **eventually be removed** on December 11th (or, if it's still seeing a lot of consumption by then, January 15th) - I'll send out an educational announcement before unpublishing the old lectures, so keep an eye on the [announcements section in the Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25888820#announcements)
- After the removal of the old lectures, their videos will be made available through a [special lecture](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25764404#announcements) in the Udemy course
- Since Udemy gives me no better updating tools (and I therefore have to provide it by inserting the new content into the existing course), **your course progress will be affected** by the update → You can fix it by manually marking lectures you'll ignore as "Completed" in the curriculum

To give you more details, this guide covers:
- [Which sections are affected](#which-sections-are-affected)
- [More details on how the update is provided](#hows-the-update-provided-to-you)
- [What happened to the old course content](#what-happened-to-the-old-course-content) (in case you're currently taking the course)
- [How you should proceed, depending on your current course progress](#how-should-you-proceed) (to ensure you're getting the best learning experience)
- [A section-by-section guide on what changed & how to continue](#section-by-section-guide-on-what-changed--how-to-continue)
- Some [FAQs](#faqs)

## Which sections are affected?

- **Almost all the sections up to the "Diving into Redux" section** (excluded, i.e., that's the first section that remains unchanged) - any other sections after that section are not affected
- Exceptions:
  - **"JavaScript Refresher"** did not change
  - **"An Alternative Way Of Building Components: Class-based Components"** did not change
  - **"Replacing Redux with React Hooks"** section was removed (though the videos can still be accessed - [learn more](#what-happened-to-the-old-course-content))
  - **Debugging**: The old lectures were unpublished to make room for the update - but they're also still accessible, [learn more](#what-happened-to-the-old-course-content)
  - **"Animating React Apps"** → old lectures were removed since this section received a big update earlier in 2023 (the old lectures which were a couple of years now were removed - but they're also still accessible, [learn more](#what-happened-to-the-old-course-content))
  - **React Hooks Summary**: This section was unpublished to make room for the update - but they're also still accessible, [learn more](#what-happened-to-the-old-course-content)
- Below you find a [section-by-section guide](#section-by-section-guide-on-what-changed--how-to-continue) that explains what changed in each affected section and what that means for you if you're currently taking that section

## How's the update provided to you?

- The new content is **inserted into the existing course** (i.e., you get it for free!)
- New content is inserted before old content → If a section is affected, its new lectures are added in front of the old lectures
- `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` separator lectures were added to separate old from new lectures
- You can therefore finish a section you're currently taking by ignoring its new lectures and then moveing to the next section where you ignore the old lectures
- The `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lectures contain links that will get you to the next lecture you should watch (i.e., the first lecture of the following section)
- A couple of sections that teach basic React concepts (e.g., "React Basics & Working with Components") were "merged" into three new "React Essentials" sections
- Since number of "basic sections" changed, the sections were not actually merged - instead, the old basic sections were moved to the end of the course and three new "React Essentials" sections were inserted after the "JavaScript Refresher" section
- If you're currently in one of these "old basic sections" (which are now marked as `LEGACY` and were moved to the end of the course), you can simply continue in there and then switch to the "Styling React Components" section once you reached the end of the "Rendering Lists & Conditional Content" section (a link is provided in the last lecture of that section)
- Alternatively, you can "restart" by going to the first lecture in the new "React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More" section (consider ramping up the video playback speed if you already learned about some key React concepts)

## What happened to the old course content?

- Old sections & lectures are marked as `LEGACY` or separated by the `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture
- The old content will be kept around until at least **December 11th 2023** - if a lot of students are consuming that old content by that time, the transition period will be prolonged until January 15th
- An educational announcement will be sent out one week before the old content gets unpublished - so check the [announcements section in the Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25888820#announcements) regularly
- Even after that date, the old videos will still be available as they will be attached to a [special lecture](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/lecture/25764404#announcements) that's in the course (i.e., you can download them from there)

## How should you proceed?

How you should proceed depends on where you currently are in the course.

### You're currently taking the course

If you're currently taking the course, you can **simply continue! You don't have to restart the course!**

*Note: If you're at the beginning of the "React Basics & Working with Components" section, you might want to consider restarting with the new "React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More" section. But you don't have to.*

By simply continuing with the course, you'll eventually reach new, updated content - from that point on you should ignore any remaining LEGACY sections or lectures.

Take a look at the below [section-by-section guide](#section-by-section-guide-on-what-changed--how-to-continue) to find out how you should continue, depending on which section you're currently in.

To **regain your course progress**, you'll have to manually **mark any lectures you ignore as completed** - unfortunately, Udemy gives me no better way of providing course updates.

### You already completed the course

You can ignore the update.

Since React itself didn't change, you don't have to go through the new content. You can of course explore the new sections & lectures if you want to (and if you want to dive into more practice & demo projects) but you don't have to.

To **regain your course progress**, you'll have to manually **mark any lectures you ignore as completed** - unfortunately, Udemy gives me no better way of providing course updates.

### You haven't started the course yet

Simply start at lecture 1 in section 1 and complete the course step-by-step, lecture-by-lecture and section-by-section in the order you find in the curriculum.

Ignore any `LEGACY` sections and lectures after a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` separator lecture.

To **fix your course progress**, you'll have to manually **mark any lectures you ignore as completed** (i.e., the LEGACY content) - unfortunately, Udemy gives me no better way of providing course updates.

## Section-by-section guide on what changed & how to continue

Any section that's not listed here (*e.g., "JavaScript Refresher"*) simply did not change (because no update was needed or because it was updated a couple of months ago already).

<details>

<summary>Getting Started [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

All lecture videos were replaced with new videos.

#### If you're curently in this section
It's recommended that you revisit the (updated) lectures 9 & 10 (which are about creating React projects). You can ignore the other updated lectures.

After this section, you should simply continue with the next section (the "JavaScript Refresher") or, if you don't need that refresher, section 3 ("React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More")

#### If you already completed this section

It's recommended that you revisit the (updated) lectures 9 & 10 (which are about creating React projects). You can ignore the other updated lectures.

</details>

<details>

<summary>React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More [NEW]</summary>

#### What changed?

This is a brand-new section which, together with the following sections ("React Essentials - Deep Dive" and "React Essentials - Practice Project") replaces the old sections "React Basics & Working with Components", "Time to Practice: Component Basics", "React State & Working with Events" & "Rendering Lists & Conditional Content".

#### Should you go through this section?

If you just started the course: Yes!

If you're already taking the course, you should instead take a look at the details available for the section you're currently in to find out how to proceed.

Generally speaking, you can ignore these "React Essentials" sections if you're already taking the course since they teach the same content as the other sections, just with an optimized structure and nicer example apps.

</details>

<details>

<summary>React Essentials - Deep Dive [NEW]</summary>

#### What changed?

This is a brand-new section which, together with the following section ("React Essentials - Practice Project") and the preceding section ("React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More") replaces the old sections "React Basics & Working with Components", "Time to Practice: Component Basics", "React State & Working with Events" & "Rendering Lists & Conditional Content".

#### Should you go through this section?

If you just started the course: Yes!

If you're already taking the course, you should instead take a look at the details available for the section you're currently in to find out how to proceed.

Generally speaking, you can ignore these "React Essentials" sections if you're already taking the course since they teach the same content as the other sections, just with an optimized structure and nicer example apps.

</details>

<details>

<summary>React Essentials - Practice Project [NEW]</summary>

#### What changed?

This is a brand-new section which, together with the preceding sections ("React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More" and "React Essentials - Deep Dive") replaces the old sections "React Basics & Working with Components", "Time to Practice: Component Basics", "React State & Working with Events" & "Rendering Lists & Conditional Content".

</details>

<details>

<summary>React Basics & Working with Components [LEGACY, MOVED TO END OF COURSE]</summary>

#### What changed?

Replaced by new "React Essentials" sections → the three new "React Essentials" sections replace this and the following old sections.

There is no 1:1 mapping between the old "React Basics & Working with Components" section and the new "React Essentials" sections - hence the old section was preserved and moved to the end of the course (so that it doesn't confuse new students who go through the course step by step).

#### If you're curently in this section

If you just started this section, it's best if you restart by going to the brand-new "React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More" section.

Otherwise, simply continue with this (and the following) sections and switch to the new, updated content after the "Rendering Lists & Conditional Content" section (switch to the "Styling React Components" section thereafter, a link will be provided at the end of the "Lists & Conditional Content" section).

If you want, you can of course switch to the new "React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More" section, no matter how far you already progressed into this old section. Consider ramping up playback speed in that case. 

If you do switch to the new, updated content (i.e., the "React Essentials" section), you should manually mark lectures in the old section as "Completed" to fix your course progress (unfortunately, Udemy gives me no way of providing updates that wouldn't mess with your course progress).

#### If you already completed this section
You can explore the brand-new "React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More" section but you don't have to.

#### If you're curently in this section

Simply continue with this (and the following) sections and switch to the new, updated content after the "Rendering Lists & Conditional Content" section (switch to the "Styling React Components" section thereafter, a link will be provided at the end of the "Lists & Conditional Content" section).

If you want, you can of course switch to the new "React Essentials - Components, JSX, Props, State & More" section, no matter how far you already progressed into these old section(s). Consider ramping up playback speed in that case. 

If you do switch to the new, updated content (i.e., the "React Essentials" section), you should manually mark lectures in the old section as "Completed" to fix your course progress (unfortunately, Udemy gives me no way of providing updates that wouldn't mess with your course progress).

<details>

<summary>Styling React Components [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

Added new lectures in front of old lectures, separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved**!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart the section, otherwise simply continue with it (i.e., ignore the new lectures).

After finishing this section, continue with the next section (the "Debugging" section) - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly).

You should mark the lectures you're ignoring (i.e., either the new or the old lectures) as "Completed" manually to fix your course progress once you finished this section.

#### If you already completed this section

You can explore the new lectures that were added at the beginning of this section but you don't have to.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Debugging React Apps [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

Replaced the lecture videos of this section with new videos. The old content was removed right away to make room for the update since this was a very short section anyways.

This section **was not moved**!

#### If you're curently in this section

Simply restart the section (it's a very short section, hence I took this approach).

#### If you already completed this section

You can ignore the updated videos / this updated section.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Time to Practice: A Complete Practice Project [LEGACY, MOVED TO END OF COURSE]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was not updated but it **was moved to the end of the course** since it's no longer needed in the updated course structure (as there are plenty of better demo & practice projects in the surrounding sections)

#### If you're curently in this section

Simply continue with the section and finish it. Thereafter, continue with the updated "Refs & Portals" section.

#### If you already completed this section

Since the lectures were not updated, nothing changes for you.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Working with Refs & Portals [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was renamed (it was previously named "Diving Deeper: Working with Fragments, Portals & Refs"). Fragments are no longer covered in the (updated) section content (since they are covered in the "React Essentials" sections now).

Added new lectures in front of old lectures, separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved**!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart the section, otherwise simply continue with it (i.e., ignore the new lectures).

After finishing this section, continue with the next section - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly).

<details>

<summary>Practice Project: Project Management App (with Components, State, Refs & More) [NEW]</summary>

#### What changed?

This is a brand-new section with a brand-new demo app.

If you're already past this section, feel free to explore it and take it as an extra practice opportunity (you don't have to, though).

</details>

<details>

<summary>React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management [NEW]</summary>

#### What changed?

This is a brand-new section, covering React's Context API.

Previously, this was covered in the next section after this section (which was named "Advanced: Handling Side Effects, Using Reducers & Using the Context API" and is now named just "Handling Side Effects with useEffect").
That section has been split up into two sections - this section here and the next section (i.e., the old, existing section which now also contains new content).

If you're already past this and the next section, you can ignore this (and the next) section. If you're currently in the next section (i.e., in the "Handling Side Effects with useEffect" section), you may want to restart with this section here (you don't have to though - see the details for the next section).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Handling Side Effects with useEffect [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was renamed and split up (see below). It was previously named "Advanced: Handling Side Effects, Using Reducers & Using the Context API".

This section was split up into two separate sections:
- (1) "React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management" - the section before this section here
- (2) "Handling Side Effects with useEffect" - this section

(1) contains only new lectures, (2) is this old section, which now contains both new and old lectures. New lectures were added in front of the old lectures, separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved** (just split up into two sections)!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart by going to the new "React's Context API & useReducer - Advanced State Management" section, otherwise simply continue with this section and the old lectures in there (i.e., ignore the new lectures).

After finishing this section, continue with the next section - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly).

You should mark the lectures you're ignoring (i.e., either the new lectures, including the ones in the newly added second section, or the old lectures) as "Completed" manually to fix your course progress once you finished this section.

#### If you already completed this section

You can explore the new lectures in both sections this section was split into.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Practice Project: Building a Quiz App [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was renamed since we're now building a different demo / practice app (it was previously named "Practice Project: Building a Food Order App").

Added new lectures (→ Quiz app) in front of old lectures (→ Food order app), separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved!**!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart the section, otherwise simply continue with it (i.e., ignore the new lectures). You can also go through both the new and old lectures to build two practice apps.

After finishing this section, continue with the next section - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly).

You should mark any lectures you're ignoring (i.e., either the new or the old lectures) as "Completed" manually to fix your course progress once you finished this section.

#### If you already completed this section

You can explore the new lectures that were added at the beginning of this section but you don't have to.

</details>

<details>

<summary>A Look Behind The Scenes Of React & Optimizing Techniques [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

Replaced the lecture videos of this section with new videos. The old content was removed right away to make room for the update since this was a very short section anyways.

This section **was not moved**!

#### If you're curently in this section

<summary>Practice Project: "Building a Food Order App [UPDATED]</summary>

#### What changed?

This section was renamed since we're now building a different demo / practice app (it was previously named "Practice Project: Adding Http & Forms To The Food Order App").

We now build a "Food Order" app from scratch in this section (instead of enhancing the old one which was built in an earlier section).

Added the new lectures (→ "Food Order" app from scratch) in front of the old lectures (→ enhancing the old "Food Order" app), separated by a `--- LEGACY CONTENT BELOW ---` lecture.

This section **was not moved**!

#### If you're curently in this section

If you have time, restart the section, otherwise simply continue with it (i.e., ignore the new lectures).

If you haven't started this section yet, you can ignore the old app - going through those old lectures only makes sense if you also built the first version of that old "Food Order" app in an earlier course section.

After finishing this section, continue with the next section - that will then already be an updated section (i.e., you switch to the updated content smoothly). 

You should mark the lectures you're ignoring (i.e., either the new or the old lectures) as "Completed" manually to fix your course progress once you finished this section.

#### If you already completed this section

You can explore the new lectures that were added at the beginning of this section but you don't have to.

## FAQs

<details>

<summary id="faq-how-to-get-update">How do I get the update?</summary>

It's free! I added brand-new lectures to the existing course. So if you're a student of this course, you can access those lectures.

To find out how you should proceed, take a look at my [progress-dependent guidelines](#how-should-you-proceed) before you then explore the [section-specific guidelines](#section-by-section-guide-on-what-changed--how-to-continue).

</details>

<details>

<summary id="faq-how-to-fix-course-progress">What happens with my course progress?</summary>

Unfortunately, Udemy gives me no great course updating tools, hence I have to provide updates by adding new lectures into existing courses.

This does affect your course progress since new lectures are added.

You can always mark lectures as "Completed" manually though - this allows you to quickly adjust the course progress such that it correctly reflects your actual progress.

</details>

<details>

<summary id="faq-how-to-continue">What does this update mean for me? How should I continue?</summary>

React itself did not change, so you don't have to restart the course or do anything like that.

How you can get the most out of this update simply depends on your current course progress.

Therefore, as a first step, take a look at my [progress-dependent guidelines](#how-should-you-proceed) before you then explore the [section-specific guidelines](#section-by-section-guide-on-what-changed--how-to-continue).

</details>

<details>

<summary id="faq-keep-old-content-around-longer">Can you keep the old content around for a longer period?</summary>

Unfortunately, Udemy gives me no great course updating tools, hence I have to provide updates by adding new lectures into existing courses.

Of course, this can cause some confusion, mess with course progress and bloat the course. That's why I'm only keeping the old, outdated content around for a limited time period (until December 11th 2023).

But I don't remove it instantly, because I want to allow existing students to finish the section(s) they are currently working on.

Therefore, I'm trying to find a good balance between removing the old content too early and too late. If it turns out that a significant number of students is still using the "old" content by the time I want to remove it, I'll probably prolong the transition period by a few weeks (until mid-January 2024). Otherwise, the content gets removed by December 11th 2023.

Of course, this can cause some confusion, mess with course progress and bloat the course. That's why I'm only keeping the old, outdated content around for a limited time period (until December 11th 2023).

But I don't remove it instantly, because I want to allow existing students to finish the section(s) they are currently working on.

Therefore, I'm trying to find a good balance between removing the old content too early and too late.
