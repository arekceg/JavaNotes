//CHALLENGE: Make this app work by applying what you've learnt.
//1. When new text is written into the input, its state should be saved.
//2. When the add button is pressed, the current data in the input should be
//added to an array.
//3. The <ul> should display all the array items as <li>s

// If you're running this locally in VS Code use the commands:
// npm install
// to install the node modules and
// npm run dev
// to launch your react project in your browser
