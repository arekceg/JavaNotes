import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

//CHALLENGE: I have extracted the Input Area, including the <input> and
//<button> elements into a seperate Component called InputArea.
//Your job is to make the app work as it did before but this time with the
//InputArea as a seperate Component.

// DO NOT: Modify the ToDoItem.jsx
// DO NOT: Move the input/button elements back into the App.jsx

//Hint 1: You will need to think about how to manage the state of the input element
//in InputArea.jsx.
//Hint 2: You will need to think about how to pass the input value back into
//the addItem() function in App.jsx.

// If you're running this locally in VS Code use the commands:
// npm install
// to install the node modules and
// npm run dev
// to launch your react project in your browser
