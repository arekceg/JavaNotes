import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

//CHALLENGE: Make the code in App.jsx work.
//The final app should have a single contact
//with fName, lName and email.

//HINT: You'll need to apply the following things you learnt:
//1. Using JS Objects with state.
//2. Making use of previous state when changing state.
//3. Working with forms in React.
//4. Handing events

// If you're running this locally in VS Code use the commands:
// npm install
// to install the node modules and
// npm run dev
// to launch your react project in your browser
